## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I recapped my knowing of changing the transparency of a color by making a new variable and also 
tried to recap my knowledge of JS in order to assign a variable the Ratign thru the innerHTML of the
button selected.
It was nice.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

```
```css

```
```js

```

### Continued development

 I want to focus on JS to assign variables and save such variables on devices or a file to be used later.

 So far,it's been good.
